#Need to do this ritual each time you initiate a new chuck
#RStudio defaults itself to the home directory when you start a new chunk
pwd; #ls #Listt everything in this directory
cat vgsales.csv
#bash command line reads the csv file and prints without tab or comma separation. But you get to see what is there. 
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head vgsales.csv
#On linux use libre office calc to open this file. Press OK when it asks you to open at tab limited file
#Next we are going to work with awk. Install awk on your linux box if not available from inception
#Select the rows that have 'Wanadoo' as production company and create a new csv file called New_Data.csv
awk '/Wanadoo/{print}' vgsales.csv > New_Data.csv
#Read the column names of vgsales.csv
awk 'NR==1{print $1}' vgsales.csv
#Total number of rows
awk 'END{print FNR}' vgsales.csv

```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv
#Note that the csv generated in this way does not have column name
#Therefore we would first create a csv file that only has the column names
rm New_Data.csv # Delete New_Data.csv we created above
head -1 vgsales.csv > New_Data.csv
#Append the output to the New_Data.csv using '>>'. if you used '>' only it would overwrite the file
awk '/Wanadoo/{print}' vgsales.csv >> New_Data.csv
#Finally open the csv file using your preferred program
libreoffice --calc New_Data.csv
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv

#Let us query other comapnies an add into this 
awk '/Nintendo/{print}' vgsales.csv >> New_Data.csv 
#Let us add few morerows
awk '/TrackMania/{print}' vgsales.csv >> New_Data.csv 
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv
#Query anything that has Micro in any of the cells and create a csv file
awk '/Micro/{ print $0 }' vgsales.csv > MicroRecords.csv
#Let us look for Tetris in 2nd (games name) row
awk -F, '$2 ~ /Tetris/' vgsales.csv > Tetris.csv
#In the example above we can truncate the noun Tetris to Tetr and see what results we get
awk -F, '$2 ~ /Tetr/' vgsales.csv > Tetris.csv #It is same result
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv

#When we want to exclude one entry from a query, it is best to suggest the column that we want to enquire
awk '$6~ !/Nintendo /' vgsales.csv > Test1.csv
#When you want to remove both Nintendo and Microsoft, try piping
awk '$6~ !/Nintendo /' vgsales.csv | awk '$6~ !/Micro /' > Test1.csv
#To get the results in rows
awk -F '[:,]' '{print $6}' vgsales.csv | awk /'Micro'/

```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv
#Note that Publisher is the sixth column. Let us read only this column
awk -F '[:,]' '{print $6}' vgsales.csv
#Let us use grep to find the microsoft in developer column
awk '{print $6}' vgsales.csv | grep 'Microsoft'
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv
#Let us add this into our product csv file
awk '/Microsoft/{print}' vgsales.csv >> New_Data.csv 
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv
#You can use the awk to query any column of your csv. In this example we would query top 100 games by ranking. We would export the outcome to a new scsv file called test1.csv. The Ranking column is $1 which we would query in this command.
awk -F'[:,]' -v limit=100 '$1 <= limit' vgsales.csv > test1.csv
#Want to query top 100 that were published by Sony?
awk -F'[:,]' -v limit=100 '$1 <= limit' vgsales.csv | awk '$6~ !/Sony/' > test1.csv
# Next we would check top 100 games that have global sales more than 20.
awk -F'[:,]' -v limit=100 '$1 <= limit && $11 >=20' vgsales.csv > test1.csv
```
```{bash}
cd  ~
cd Documents; head New_Data.csv

#In order to sort based on a certain column we need to use the sort command from bash
#awk -F'[:,]' -v limit=100 '$1 <= limit' vgsales.csv > Test2.txt #Sorting by 5th column name
awk '/Atari/{print}' vgsales.csv > Test2.txt 
sort -t: -k5 Test2.txt > Test3.csv
